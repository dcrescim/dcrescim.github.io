  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every once in a great while, it's nice to tear up everything you thought about yourself.</p>
<p>It was pretty obvious to my parents, that I was destined to become a math and computer geek. I was obsessed with math riddles and mental calculation when I was young. My first program was a &quot;metronome&quot; in Visual Basic. It was a glorified button which played the system beep sound at intolerable levels. I used it to practice playing drums. That was the first year that my dad got noise-cancelling headphones. But it wasn't until I got my hands on 'The Art of Problem Solving', that I began to really <em>grok</em> things.</p>
<p>I learned that mathematics has nothing to do with memorization. It has almost nothing to do with formulas.
It has everything to do with experimentation, and gaining a global intuition from much smaller examples.
Oh yeah, and it has to do with sitting in front of thousands and thousands of problems.</p>
<p>High school was a daze of math problems and competitions. AMC, AIME, ARML, etc. Anything I could get my hands on. My scores were good enough on these national exams, that I was invited to join Lehigh's 15-member team. My junior year, we place second in the nation at the ARML competition.</p>
<p>From all this I gained two truths:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Nothing impresses girls more than stories about your &quot;rowdy&quot; days at math camp</li>
<li>The point of learning things is to <strong>know</strong> things, not know the <strong>names</strong> of things</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, college happened. The cool kids at Carnegie Mellon wrote programs, so I dived way deeper into computer science. Again &quot;cool&quot; is a relative term here. So it is really no surprise that I find machine learning so appealing, as its a way to combine math and computer science to do some pretty sweet things.</p>
<p>The current state of machine learning pains me, though.</p>
<p>Number 2, above all things, pains me the most about the current state of Machine Learning. It seems that we are in the process of renaming and &quot;sexifying&quot; everything. That is why I started this blog, to pull back some of the curtains on our favorite algorithms, and making them more manageable. Take Neural Nets for instance. They have this &quot;algorithm&quot; by which they update their internal weights. This allows them to change and make a better model. This thing is called &quot;backpropogation&quot;. This thing should be called &quot;take a partial derivative&quot;. That's right. You heard it hear first folks. Backpropogation is just you taking a partial derivative. Also a &quot;layer of neurons&quot; is just a matrix and a function. Santa Claus is not real either.</p>
<p>Follow me on a journey through machine learning, where we implement all of it, without the lingo, but with the understanding.</p>
<p>Pop Quiz:
What do the following have in common?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Perceptron</li>
<li>Neural Nets</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>They all have the exact same update function. That's right. 4 very different names. Identical update function. You compute the partial derivative of your error function, and then you walk down it (this is called Gradient Descent)
So we are going to right that code once, and then code all 4 of these things in one go.</p>
<p>Good quotes where you make fun of Hastie</p>
<p>And I may be alone in this, but usually when I'm learning something, I don't already know it.</p>
